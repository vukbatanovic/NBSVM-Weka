# Description (required)
Description=This package contains a Java implementation of the NBSVM algorithm which was first presented as a binary classifier in "Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification," Sida Wang, Christopher D. Manning, in Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2012), pp. 90-94, Jeju Island, South Korea (2012). This version extends the original algorithm to also support multiclass (one-vs-all) classification. The code relies on the LibLINEAR library and its Weka wrapper class. See the webpage for more information.
