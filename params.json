{"name":"NBSVM-Weka","tagline":"An implementation of the NBSVM classifier for Weka","body":"﻿# NBSVM-Weka - a Java implementation of the multiclass NBSVM classifier for Weka\r\nNBSVM is an algorithm, originally designed for binary text/sentiment classification, which combines the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier with the Support Vector Machine (SVM).\r\nIt does so through the element-wise multiplication of standard feature vectors by the positive class/negative class ratios of MNB log-counts. Such vectors are then used as inputs for the SVM classifier.\r\n\r\nThis implementation extends the [original algorithm](http://github.com/sidaw/nbsvm) to support multiclass classification using the one-vs-all approach.\r\nWhen dealing with *N* classes the classifier calculates *N* distinct ratios of MNB log-counts by separately considering each class as 'positive' and all the other classes taken together as 'negative'.\r\nThese ratios are then combined with the input feature vectors of *N* separate discriminative classifiers.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nThis package relies on the [LibLINEAR library](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/) and its [Weka wrapper class](http://github.com/bwaldvogel/liblinear-weka). The LibLINEAR Weka package must be installed in order for NBSVM-Weka to function.\r\nSince it uses LibLINEAR, logistic regression can easily be used as the discriminative classifier instead of SVM (thereby maximizing the log-likelihood instead of the SVM margin).\r\n\r\nCertain SVMTypes in the LibLINEAR package which are not compatible with (this implementation of) NBSVM, such as Support Vector Regression models or Crammer and Singer's multiclass classification algorithm, have been disabled.\r\nHowever, for the sake of consistency, the numbering of options used in LibLINEAR has been preserved.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nNBSVM-Weka can be installed as an unofficial plug-in module within Weka.\r\nTo do so, download the [NBSVM-Weka package](https://github.com/vukbatanovic/NBSVM-Weka/releases/download/v1.0.1/NBSVM-Weka_1.0.1.zip).\r\nOpen the Weka package manager and use the \"Unofficial - File/URL\" option to select and install NBSVM-Weka.\r\nAfter restarting Weka, the list of available classifiers (within the functions category) will contain the NBSVM option.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThe classifier can be used either through the Weka GUI or through the command line interface.\r\nEither way, the configuration options are very similar to the options of LibLINEAR's wrapper for Weka.\r\nOne difference is that NBSVM-Weka is not compatible with Support Vector Regression and Crammer and Singer's multiclass classification algorithm, making those SVMTypes disabled.\r\n\r\nIn addition, NBSVM-Weka allows the user to specify the Laplace smoothing parameter alpha (*default: 1.0*) and the interpolation parameter beta (*default: 0.25*).\r\nThese parameters can be set in the command line options as -A <double> (for Laplace smoothing) and -X <double> (for interpolation). \r\n\r\n## References\r\nIf you wish to use the NBSVM classifier in your paper or project, please cite the original paper:\r\n\r\n**[Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification](http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/sidaw12_simple_sentiment.pdf)**, Sida Wang, Christopher D.
